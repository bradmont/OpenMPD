The goal of OpenMPD is to automate as much of the data management involved in
MPD and MPM (Ministry Partner Maintenance) as possible, and to mine your donor
data to help you more deeply understand, and serve, your partnership base. For
the time being, we are primarily targeting MPM use cases, but may eventually expand 
to a full MPD toolkit as development continues.

Our design philosophy is ***"Zero User Input."*** The time we spend
anaysing donor data is much better done by a computer, so OpenMPD aims to
eliminate as much of this work as possible. The only exception is to configure the 
user's account(s) with TntMPD.DataServer instances provided by his missions 
organisations.



### Current Status:
- **Version 1.1 is released!** You can [download OpenMPD on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.bradmont.openmpd).

As it stands, OpenMPD is fully functional as an MPM tool. We may eventually add more MPD features, but there is some significant refactoring to do beforehand, such as:
- [ ] Switching to a better (not homebrewed) DAO library
- [ ] Using Bayesing matching for partner evaluation

Below, you can see some of the ideas we have had for future development. If you'd like to lend a hand, please get in touch!

### Milestone 2 Goals
- [ ] **"MPM/Partner communications" release**
- [ ] Manage, track regular contact with regular partners
- [ ] Integration with MailChimp, etc to evaluate partner engagement
- [ ] Social network integration
    

### Milestone 3 Goals
- [ ] **MPD release**
- [ ] Namestorming features
- [ ] Appointment scheduling
- [ ] Followup scheduling/automation
- [ ] Web beacon support for emails

### Other development goals
- [ ] Networked Use, to coordinate couples or groups developing support together
