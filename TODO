--- before beta 1 ---
- in onboarding cards, use buttons for actions instead of clicking the cards

- hide debug screen

--- post beta1 point releases ---
Polish/tweaks:
- quick actions on notifications (email, call)
- Cache data for GraphCard into temp table to make rendering faster/UI more responsive
    - build this table after data download to keep UI snappy
    - on data invalidation (eg, "this is monthly", "this is annual") drop temp table
    - on add graph card, verify existence of table and rebuild it if necessary

- bug: editing accounts doesn't set spinner properly

Settings:
- option to notify only in business hours
- changeable update frequency
