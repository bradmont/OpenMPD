Polish/tweaks:
- Cache data for GraphCard into temp table to make rendering faster/UI more responsive
    - Coded, not verified working after data download
        - could force generate on data download to make app start faster
    - "Set as monthly" invalidates the cache, but the graph doesn't redraw until the activity is rebuilt

- bug: editing accounts doesn't set spinner properly

Settings:
- option to notify only in business hours
- changeable update frequency
